# \<resize-observer\>

## Introduction
\<resize-observer\> is a declarative Custom Element wrapper to the ResizeObserver API, and implements @que-etc's [ResizeObserver Polyfill](https://github.com/que-etc/resize-observer-polyfill).

For now, the API accepts just 1 element at a time, in contract to the native implementation.
